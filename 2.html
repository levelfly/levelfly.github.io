    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>
    <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>
    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p>
    <ui>
        <li>Walla Walla</li>
        <li>WA</li>
        <li>Magic City</li>
        <li>ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful</li>
        <li>UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance</li>
        <li>CO</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences</li>
        <li>NM</li>
        <li>Why</li>
        <li>AZ</li>
    </ui>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
    <ui>
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital</li>
        <li>camera</li>
        <Li>a protein bar</Li>
    </ui>
    <p>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
